		<p> What is Bitcoin? </p>
		<p> Bitcoin is a digital currency created in January 2009 following the housing market crash. 
		It follows the ideas set out in a whitepaper by the mysterious and pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto
		The identity of the person or persons who created the technology is still a mystery. 
		Bitcoin offers the promise of lower transaction fees than traditional online payment mechanisms and is operated by a decentralized authority.
		There are no physical bitcoins, only balances kept on a public ledger that everyone has transparent access to, that along with all Bitcoin transactions is verified by a massive amount of computing power.
		Bitcoins are not issued or backed by any banks or governments. Despite it not being legal tender, Bitcoin charts high on popularity, and has triggered the launch of hundreds of other virtual currencies collectively referred to as Altcoins. </p>
		<li> Launched in 2009, Bitcoin is the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap. </li>
		<li> Unlike fiat currency, Bitcoin is created, distributed, traded, and stored with the use of a decentralized ledger system known as a blockchain. </li>
		<li> Bitcoin's history as a store of value has been turbulent; the cryptocurrency skyrocketed up to roughly $20,000 per coin in 2017, but as of two years later, is currency trading for less than half of that. </li>
		<li> As the earliest cryptocurrency to meet widespread popularity and success, Bitcoin has inspired a host of other projects in the blockchain space. </li>
